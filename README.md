# DEEP-LEARNING-PROJECT

Company:CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

INTERN ID:CT04DG851

DOMAIN: DATA SCIENCE

DURATION:4 WEEKS

MENTOR:NEELA SANTOSH

DESCRIPITON OF THE TASK: As part of my internship with CODTECH, I completed Task-2, which focused on building an image classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The main goal of this project was to train a deep learning model to classify images into different categories using the CIFAR-10 dataset.
CIFAR-10 is a popular dataset that contains 60,000 color images divided into 10 classes such as airplane, car, cat, dog, frog, ship, and truck. Each image is very small (just 32x32 pixels), which makes it useful for training fast models, especially for beginners.

I used Python along with TensorFlow and Keras to build the CNN model. The steps I followed in this project included:
Loading and preprocessing the CIFAR-10 dataset
Designing a CNN model with multiple convolution, pooling, and dropout layers
Compiling the model with the Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy loss
Training the model for 10 epochs
Evaluating the performance on test data
Visualizing training accuracy using graphs
Predicting a random image and comparing predicted vs actual labels

During training, I observed improvements in both training and validation accuracy. By the end of 10 epochs, the model achieved more than 80% accuracy on training data and around 72% on test data, which is a good result for a basic CNN model.

One of the challenges I faced was that the CIFAR-10 images appeared blurry when displayed, since they are very low resolution. To fix this, I used the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to resize the image to 128x128 pixels using nearest-neighbor interpolation. This made the output much clearer and easier to understand.

This task helped me understand the basics of deep learning, especially how CNNs work for image classification. I also learned how to visualize model performance using Matplotlib and how to build an end-to-end machine learning project using VS Code.

In the end, I successfully completed Task-2 by submitting the Python code, training output, accuracy graph, and a sample prediction. This project has given me a strong foundation in deep learning and boosted my confidence in building and presenting machine learning models.
